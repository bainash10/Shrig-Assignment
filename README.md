# Shrig Assignment

This repository contains two separate tasks for processing rectangle images:
1. **Task 1 – Rectangle Numbering**  
   Assign numbers (1 to 4) inside each rectangle based on the length of a line drawn inside it.  
   - **Shorter line represents Lower number**  
   - **No reordering of the rectangles in the original image**  

2. **Task 2 – Rectangle Alignment**  
   Align and straighten all given rectangle images so they are upright (deskewed).
